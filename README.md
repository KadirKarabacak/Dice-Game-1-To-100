# ðŸŽ² Dice-Game
This project is a small dice rolling game.
### ðŸ¤” What is the main logic of this game?
* Players start rolling the dice, the first one to reach "**101**" wins the game.
* Each player has their own turn, if one player rolls the dice and gets a "**1**", the turn passes to the other player.
* Before the dice hit 1, players can use the **"hold"** button to add up the number of each dice they roll and add it to their digits.
